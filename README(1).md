# Discord AI Voice Bot

A Discord bot that records voice in a channel, transcribes it into text using AssemblyAI, generates a response using OpenAI, and plays the generated response back in the channel.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Record Voice**: Capture live voice input from a user in a voice channel.
- üìù **Transcribe Audio**: Convert recorded voice into text using AssemblyAI.
- ü§ñ **Generate Response**: Generate a conversational response using OpenAI Chat API with audio output.
- üîä **Play Response**: Play the AI-generated audio response back in the same voice channel.

## Demo

### Workflow
1. User joins a voice channel and starts recording via a button command.
2. The bot captures the user's voice, processes the audio, and transcribes the text.
3. The transcribed text is sent to OpenAI, which generates a conversational audio response.
4. The bot plays the AI-generated audio in the voice channel.
